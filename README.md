## Title: Predicting Crypto with Algorithmic Trading 

## Team: Thomas Forget, Brad Kaley, Anjan Amin, Bill McCarthy 

### Project Description: We are a new team within an investment firm looking to enter the CryptoCurrency space with a passively managed algorithmic trading package that performs better than the S&P for our clients. Due to limited resources management has tasked our team with building & testing a Time Series & Neutral Network model in order to predict future performance. Then evaluate our models and draw general conclusions based on our performance.
